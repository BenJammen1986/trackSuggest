          <h3>At Epicodus, we believe that every person:</h3><br>
          <ul>
          <li> Has the <em><u>ability</em></u> to learn programming, and<br></li>
          <li> Should be given the <em><u>opportunity</em></u> to learn programming if they so desire-<br>
          <em>regardless of their background or financial situation.</li></em><br>

            It's important for <strong>YOU</strong> to make sure that you fully understand:
            <ol>
              <li>The commitment that you are making (time, money, energy, etc...)</li>
              <li>The type of <strong><em>mindset</strong></em> it takes to become a successful developer.</li>
            </ol><br>

            If you are just looking at <a href="https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=developer&l=Portland%2C+OR" target="_blank">Indeed</a> or <a href="https://www.monster.com/jobs/search/?q=java&client=classic" target="_blank">Monster</a> or <a href="http://www.careerbuilder.com/jobs-c%23?keywords=C%23&location=" target="_blank">Careerbuilder</a> and see all the <em>opportunities/income potential</em> within programming - and there ARE many opportunities available - you may need to <strong>take a step back and re-evaluate.</strong><br><br>
          </p>
          <p>
            We hope you understand: <em>We aren't trying to discourage you!</em><br><br>On the contrary, we simply believe that it's important for you to have a BIG WHY: to know exactly why you've chosen to make this change in your life, and your purpose/goals that you want to accomplish once you finish. For most people, <span class="bg-info" id="highlight1">their driving motivation for completing a <u>challenging, monumental task</u> has to be a little deeper than simply "I can make XYZ dollars doing it"!</span> That's probably not going to get you through the intensity of this program.<br><br>If you choose to come to Epicodus, we want you to be <strong>completely committed</strong> and focused, so that you can finish well and be not only successful in graduating, but be thoroughly satisfied with the career you've chosen!<br><br>
