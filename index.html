          <h3>At Epicodus, we believe that every person:</h3><br>
          <ul>
          <li> Has the <em><u>ability</em></u> to learn programming, and<br></li>
          <li> Should be given the <em><u>opportunity</em></u> to learn programming if they so desire-<br>
          <em>regardless of their background or financial situation.</li></em><br>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>

            It's important for <strong>YOU</strong> to make sure that you fully understand:
            <ol>
              <li>The commitment that you are making (time, money, energy, etc...)</li>
              <li>The type of <strong><em>mindset</strong></em> it takes to become a successful developer.</li>

          </p>
          <p>
            We hope you understand: <em>We aren't trying to discourage you!</em><br><br>On the contrary, we simply believe that it's important for you to have a BIG WHY: to know exactly why you've chosen to make this change in your life, and your purpose/goals that you want to accomplish once you finish. For most people, <span class="bg-info" id="highlight1">their driving motivation for completing a <u>challenging, monumental task</u> has to be a little deeper than simply "I can make XYZ dollars doing it"!</span> That's probably not going to get you through the intensity of this program.<br><br>If you choose to come to Epicodus, we want you to be <strong>completely committed</strong> and focused, so that you can finish well and not only be successful in graduating, but be thoroughly satisfied with the career you've chosen!<br><br>

            So: your first step in your journey is to go through the questionnaire below and answer the questions <strong><em>as honestly as you can.</strong></em>

            <h4>It looks like you may be a good fit for one of our programming tracks!</h4><br>
            <p>Just as it is important to make sure that you have the right personality to work in the programming world in general- it is also a good idea to gauge what kind of work environment you will thrive in:
            <ul>
              <li>Would you like to work with a large company with more structure?</li>
              <li>Or rather: smaller teams, risk/reward of startups?</li>
              <li>Are you more geared towards design (front end) or function/logic (back end programming)?</li>
            </ul></p>

              <p></p>
              <h4><strong>About the Java programming language:</strong></h4>
              <p>"Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.</p>
              <p>Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. As of 2016, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers." <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">(Wikipedia)</a>"</p>
